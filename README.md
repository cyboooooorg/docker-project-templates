Since Docker is a very powerful tool, it is often used in many projects. However, it is not always easy to start a new project with Docker. This repository aims to provide a set of templates for Docker projects. Each template is a complete project that can be used as a starting point for your own project. The templates are designed to be easy to use and to provide a consistent structure for your projects.

It is important to note that these templates are not intended to be used as is. They are only intended to be used as a starting point for new projects. Indeed, each project is different and requires different tools. Therefore, it is important to adapt the templates to the needs of each project.

This repository provides templates for many languages and tools. However, it is not possible to provide templates for all languages and tools. Therefore, if you want to add a template for a language or tool that is not yet available, please feel free to contribute to this repository.
